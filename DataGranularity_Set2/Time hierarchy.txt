For time hierarchy, maybe grouping different times would be worth, for example: Dawn, Morning, Lunch time, Noon, Dinner time, Night, Dawn... In order to see the different crashes
during those times. For Date hierarchy that might be more difficult but we could group the dates into three different groups: Weekday, Weekend and Holiday.

With the opening and closing of factories and with less people utilising their cars there will probably be possible to observe a 'daily' seasonality of emissions.
