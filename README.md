# Data Science project

## Project for the data science course for 2021-2022

With this project, we use the **KDD process** to correctly and in an organizing way **analyse our datasets and make predictions**.

In this project we are going to work with two datasets. Both datasets have two smaller subsets, one tabular and the other temporal (as a series).
