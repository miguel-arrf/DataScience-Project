For set 1, we only have two numeric variables and one of them is an ID so we won't be changing that one for sure. The other numeric variable is the
person's age and that one might be worth grouping,we can't actually see if the bins are worth something, since we have some outliers but we can deal and group the data in different
age groups like children, teens, adults, elders...
